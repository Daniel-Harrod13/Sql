# SQL Filtering Text

## Description
This README note provides an overview of SQL filtering techniques for text data. It covers concepts like the LIKE operator, NOT LIKE operator, wildcard usage, and filtering with multiple conditions using the WHERE clause.

## LIKE Operator
The LIKE operator is used with the WHERE clause to search for a pattern in a text field. It supports two wildcards:
- Percent (%) wildcard matches zero, one, or many characters in the text.
- Underscore (_) wildcard matches a single character.

```sql
-- Example: Match names starting with "Ad"
SELECT * 
FROM people 
WHERE name LIKE 'Ad%';

-- Example: Match three-letter names ending with "e"
SELECT * 
FROM people 
WHERE name LIKE '__e';
```

## NOT LIKE Operator
The NOT LIKE operator is used to find records that do not match the specified pattern. It is case-sensitive.

```sql
-- Example: Find records without "A." in the first name
SELECT * 
FROM people 
WHERE name NOT LIKE 'A.%';
```

## Wildcard Position
Wildcards can be placed anywhere and combined to search for values that start, end, or contain certain characters.

```sql
-- Example: Find names ending with "r"
SELECT * 
FROM people 
WHERE name LIKE '%r';

-- Example: Find records where the third character is "t"
SELECT * 
FROM people 
WHERE name LIKE '__t%';
```

## Filtering with WHERE and OR
To filter based on multiple conditions or a range of numbers, you can use the OR keyword in the WHERE clause. However, using the IN operator can make it easier and cleaner.

```sql
-- Example: Select film titles released in 1920, 1930, or 1940
SELECT title 
FROM films 
WHERE release_year = 1920 OR release_year = 1930 OR release_year = 1940;
```

## Filtering with WHERE and IN
The IN operator allows specifying multiple values in the WHERE clause, simplifying the process of setting multiple OR conditions.

```sql
-- Example: Find film titles with associated country as Germany or France
SELECT title 
FROM films 
WHERE country IN ('Germany', 'France');
```
