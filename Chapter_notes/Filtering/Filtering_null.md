# SQL Filtering Techniques

## Description
This README provides an overview of SQL filtering techniques, focusing on handling NULL values. It covers concepts like identifying missing values, using the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators, and understanding the importance of handling NULL values in data analysis.

## NULL Values
In SQL, NULL represents a missing or unknown value. Dealing with NULL values is crucial as they can impact the accuracy of our analyses, especially when working with incomplete data.

## Identifying Missing Values
When analyzing data, it's important to differentiate between missing and non-missing values. Using the COUNT keyword, we can determine the number of missing values in a field.

## Filtering with IS NULL
To quickly identify NULL values, we can use the IS NULL operator with the WHERE clause. This allows us to filter records that have missing values in a specific field.

```sql
-- Example: Find names without a recorded birthdate
SELECT name
FROM people
WHERE birthdate IS NULL;
```

## Filtering with IS NOT NULL
Sometimes, we want to exclude missing values and focus only on non-NULL records. The IS NOT NULL operator helps us achieve this by filtering out records with missing values.

```sql
-- Example: Count the number of people with non-missing birth dates
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM people
WHERE birthdate IS NOT NULL;
```

## COUNT() vs IS NOT NULL
Using COUNT with a field name and using COUNT with a WHERE clause and IS NOT NULL have the same effect. Both methods count non-missing values in a field.

## NULL Put Simply
NULL values are common in real-world databases due to empty fields or missing information. It's essential to identify and handle NULL values using the IS NULL or IS NOT NULL operators. These keywords help us select or exclude missing values from our queries.
